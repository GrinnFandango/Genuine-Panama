#### User Stories

* As a fan, I want to find out when and where this band will be playing. I would also like to find out where I can purchase merchandise. To do this, I had created timeline on the 'showdates.html' page to show the locations and dates of each upcoming show. I had also created a '_blank' link to an external page so visitors and fans can potentially buy the bands merch.

* As a visitor, I would like to find out some information about this band, what their music sounds like and how I can further follow them on social media sites. To do this, social media links have been added to the footer of each page and an embed link has been added to the 'index.html' page so users can listen to a snippet of their 'Latest Single'.

* As an agent, I would like to be able to contact this band so I can find out whether I can book them for any shows. In order for this to happen, I had added a contact form on the 'booking.html' page that could be used to get in touch with the band, as well as adding their contact details to the footer of each page.
